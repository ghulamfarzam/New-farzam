	 * 1. HashSet: 
	 * - HashSet is a class Implements by Set interface
	 * - HashSet is Not accepting duplicated values (References). 
	 * - there is no order on HashSet.
	 * - there is no Indexing accessible in HashSet
	 * - Only way to retrieve data in HashSet is to loop them using "for each". 
	 * 
	 *  2. TreeSet: 
	 *  - TreeSet is a Class implements by Set Interface. 
	 *  - TreeSet is Unordered collection.
	 *  - TreeSet is a unique collection.  
	 *  - There is no Index accessible in TreeSet
	 *  - Only way to retrieve data in HashSet is to loop them using "for loop".
	 *  - Values will be sorted internally in TreeSet.

	 * Difference between List and Set

	 * 4. to retrieve data for Set have to use "For each loop, List we can retrieve by index number.
