	 * OOPs concepts (Object Oriented Programming Concepts). 
	 * 1. Encapsulation: mechanism that hiding data in class by making instance 
	 * 	(class) variables private and providing in-direct access with getters and setters. 
	 * 2. Inheritance: sub-class inherit class variables and methods of super-class
	 * 3. Polymorphism: a method/constructor can have different forms. 
	 *  a. Overloading: happening in the same class with different parameters. 
	 *  b. Overriding: happening in inheritance while a sub-class override implementation 
	 *  	of a method in super-class. 
	 *  4. Abstraction: mechanism to restrict object creation of a class. 
	 *  a. abstract classes: partial abstract and have to be used in inheritance. 
	 *  	to make an abstract class use abstract keyword in class signature. 
	 *  	and use it with inheritance and extends sub-class to super-class  
	 *  b. interface: fully abstract and have to implement them to the classes.
	 *  	Abstract methods made by default.
