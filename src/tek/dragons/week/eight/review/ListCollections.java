	 * Similarities and Differences: 
	 * Similarities
	 * ArrayList and LinkedList are flexible in size (Re-sizable). 
	 * ArrayList and LinkedList are Generic Type. 
	 * Both of them takes only non-primitive data type and Generic type. 
	 * to use primitive data type we have to use Wrapper Classes. 
	 * 
	 * Differences
	 * LinkedList have references about previous and next element. 
	 * LinkedList is more used for manipulating Data in Collection. 
	 * LinkedList have some more useful method for first and last element.
